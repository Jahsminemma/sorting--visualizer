This is a progressive web app built using Vanilla Javascript to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as bubble, insertion, selection, merge, quick and heap sort. This app is deployed with GitHub pages and can be accessed here: [Link](https://anandman03.github.io/sorting-and-searching-visualizer/). I hope you have fun playing around with it.

## New Version
The new version of this project can be found here: [Link](https://github.com/anandman03/Sorting-Visualizer).

## Purpose

I wanted to improve my skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also learn classic sorting algorithms.This project turned out to be a great way to achieve both of the aforementioned objectives at the same time.

## Conventions

* `index.html` - This file holds the main layout for home page.

* `css` - This folder contains the CSS files that only contain CSS custom properties declarations (also known as CSS variables) for the entirety of the app. These files are used to determine the overall look and feel of the application as all components rely upon these variables.

* `js` - This folder contains the JavaScript files for implementing the sorting algorithms using the Object Oriented Programming principles.

## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**.
2. **Insertion Sort**.
3. **Selection Sort**.
4. **Merge Sort**.
5. **Quick Sort**.
2. **Heap Sort**.
